					<h5>How you do in the hood</h5>
					<h6>as told by Freddie Smith</h6>
					<p>Freddy Smith used to hang out on a corner just like it when he was younger.</p>
					<p>"Where we got to go? From this end to that end is apartments,” he says. "They got a law there saying you can't go in the [recreation] center because it's a summertime camp. And you can't stand there because it's a church."</p>
					<p> The corner is the neighborhood gathering spot, where residents go to shoot dice or shoot the breeze. And yeah, Smith agreed, some go there to sell drugs, which have been part of the local economy as long as he’s lived in Dixon.</p>
					<p>"All the young kids doing now is trying to keep a dollar in their pockets," Smith said. "Nobody coming to nobody putting a pistol upside their head, say 'you should have bought my stuff.'" </p>
				</div>

				<div class="dixonStory noShow clearFix">

					<p>A block down the street from the corner store, two women sit in the park smoking cigarettes. One carries a baseball bat in her purse. </p>
					<p>They have lived in Dixon nearly all their lives, and will only talk about the men at the store if their names aren’t used.</p>
					<p>Woman 1: That store has been there forever. And half the people who hang at that store right now don’t live over here.</p>
					<p>Woman 2: They come and destroy our neighborhood. That’s what they do every day, seven days a week.</p>
					<p>Woman 1: I won’t even stop at the store ... I take my bat that way. I’m not going to say I’ll use the bat, but they don’t know I won’t. And see, all those that know me, first thing they want to know is where is my bat!</p>
					<p>Woman 2: They had two shootings in less than a month at the store. One boy got shot six times, and the other guy got his intestines shot out.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="dixonStory noShow clearFix">
					<p>A faint stench of pot wafts into Dixon Grocery each time the door swings open. And the door swings constantly as the men who loited outside day and night come in for beer, cigar and the occasional violent crime.</p>
					<p>Behind the counter, William Morel points to a display stand lined with trespass warnings.</p>
					<p>"I have to call the police," he says. "Look at this. How many do you see right there? One two three four five six seven eight."</p>
					<p>But the men come back as soon as the police roll out.</p>
					<p>"If you come 5, 6, 8 o'clock you're going to see the same people," Morel says. "Selling drugs, all day. All kinds of drugs."</p>
					<p>In April, a fistfight over a small debt ended after one man fetched a pistol from his SUV and shot the other in the leg. It was the second shooting in the store parking lot that month.</p>
