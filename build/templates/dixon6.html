                <p>As a boy, Larry Johnson liked to fight. As punishment, he was sent to boxing classes with the cops.</p>

<p>Boxing led to basketball, and basketball led Larry out of Dixon. The Charlotte Hornets took him in the 1990s, then the New York Knicks.</p>

<p>If Dixon Circle has a legend, a hero—it is Larry Johnson. Not only did he become an NBA star, but for a long time he kept coming back to the neighborhood he called home, raising Dixon up with him. </p>

<p>Johnson gave $1 million to the city to build a recreation center that is now the neighborhood’s sanctuary. No drugs here, no bullets. The sound of children’s laughter and splashing fountains mask the traffic and disorder across the street like a force field.</p>

<p>Across the avenue from the park, a lattice of steel stands two stories high in a patch of weeds. It has stood like that for ten years. And this was also Johnson’s hand.</p>

<p>Some in the neighborhood say it was going to be a rehab center, or maybe a church. He had intended to build a child care facility, according to city records. No one involved with the project returned calls about it. </p>

<p>Johnson lives in New York now, and isn’t seen in Dixon anymore. </p>
