        <h3>The people</h3>
        <h4>Word spread along Dixon Avenue that Harper lay dead, shot in the back. Hundreds poured into the street, some with pistols, toward a line of cops with shields and rifles.</h4>

                <p>Freddie walked away from the horse pen and stood in his yard, thinking about what he'd seen. He might have ended his day there, he says, had a police officer not ordered him inside.</p>

<p>"Why I got to go in my house because y'all have done something?" Freddie says. "Everybody started calling people. Everybody came from everywhere, because they knew that the police done shot somebody."</p>

<p>Harper's mother staggered up the avenue, held aloft by a swelling crowd. Harper’s sister stood at the police line, speaking in sobs: "Why they do this to my brother? Why they kill him?"</p>

<p>People watched from behind apartment fences, shooting cellphone video through coils of barbed wire. Then they poured into the street, and by evening people were driving from across the city to see the upheaval of Dixon Circle. </p>

<p>By the time a column of police in riot gear marched down Dixon, hundreds packed the avenue.</p>

<p>A fistfight broke out somewhere in the throng. Pistols flashed on both sides of the police line. An officer fired a burst of pellets into the street, trying to disperse the crowd.</p>

<p>Freddie Smith called himself a Black Panther than evening. "I see a lot of white folks and no black folks!" he screamed at the police as the sun sank over Dixon Avenue. </p>

                <h6>as told by Rev. Freeney and his brother</h6>

                <p>In 1992, when Rev. Earnest Freeney’s church was young, a crowd along Dixon Avenue threw rocks and bottles at passing cars after four police officers in Los Angeles were acquitted of beating a black taxi driver, Rodney King. Twenty years later, as a crowd swelled outside Dixon Circle Missionary Baptist, the reverend and his brother went into the street to plead for peace.</p>

<p>Paul: When we were in the zone, what I call the zone, you have cops on one side with automatic weapons. You name it, they have it. And then you got, I'm gonna just say the people. Okay?</p>

<p>Rev. Freeney: I just thank God that I wasn't cut in half. Could have been.</p>

<p>Paul: You know, we had to tell a couple officers to stand down, because if he attempted to arrest a person he would create a riot. ‘Let him go home, even though he has a gun.’</p>

<p>Rev. Freeney: They had guns, and were ready to go to war. </p>

                <h5>Jump off</h5>
                <h6>as told by Dwaine Caraway</h6>

                <p>Dixon Circle’s city councilman walked into the crowd that evening knowing the neighborhood’s reputation, but with no idea what to expect.</p>

<p>“This was breaking news on every radio and every television station,” Dwaine Caraway says. "Folks that was mad, they start coming in from everywhere: Pleasant Grove, Oak Cliff, Duncanville, DeSoto. Everybody began to converge in on Dixon Circle.”</p>

<p>Caraway pressed through the throng, towards the body. At the police line, an officer in riot gear looked ready to crack. An assistant police chief had to pull him off the line.</p>

<p>Caraway praises the cops’ restraint that night. But the real danger was the crowd, growing ever larger and louder, feeding off the anguish of Harper’s family. </p>

<p>"Something was going to jump off,” Caraway says.</p>

<p>He persuaded police to let the family past the blockade—not to where the body lay, but at least to put a few feet between their sobs and the crowds shouts.</p>

<p>“Look, you lost your loved one,” he told the family, “I understand that.” </p>

<p>They cut him off: “They won’t let me go back and see him! I want to see my son!”</p>

<p>“And next thing you know, I’m told that the body had been removed,” Caraway says. “So now I had to go back to this family and tell them that.” </p>

<p>Another volley of anguish: “Oh, we knew they were lying!” </p>

<p>“They’re hollering so loud the crowd can hear them. Now the crowd is getting fizzed up,” Caraway says. </p>

<p>“I don’t know what the hell to say next. I looked up, and there was not a street light on this corner—and I know that if it got dark we would have a problem."</p>

<p>He told the police that the family had to go, lest the crowd boil over. Police agreed, and they coaxed Harper’s relatives into a vehicle with the promise that they could see Harper’s body at the morgue. Only after they were driven away did Dixon Circle fall quiet. </p>

<p>"Had we not handled it the way that it was handled, then they would have burned downtown," Caraway says. </p>
