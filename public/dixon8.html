        <h4>Sgt. Sheldon Smith pulls up to the corner store late one August morning. A crowd of young men scatters from the parking lot. Only Bryson “Godbody” Busby holds his ground.</h4>

                <p>The sergeant asks Busby he remembers when police played basketball in Dixon Circle, after the near-riot. Busby was in prison at the time, but the two men get to talking. They speak not of basketball, but of cops and the corner.</p>

<p>Bryson Busby: We scared of them; they scared of us. You know what I'm saying? Everybody's scared. Shit got our women scared. I been getting texts lately, like: ‘make sure you let me know that you're in the house.’ All my years growing up and being affiliated in the streets, and moving how I move, I ain’t never got any texts like that.</p>

<p>Sgt. Smith: What about the crime? The jacking, the robbing. We got one eye open all the time.</p>

<p>BB: I know how to see a jack boy coming. I can't tell no friendly police officer, if you ready to help me or you ready to take me down.</p>

<p>Sgt: You been to jail before?</p>

<p>BB: I just got out two and a half years now. Seven years, seven months on an eight year sentence for a murder case I caught right across the street.</p>

<p>Sgt: So, you working?</p>

<p>BB: I go to the barber college up on Martin Luther King.</p>

<p>Sgt: Excellent. Excellent</p>

<p>BB: I'm about a month away from graduating. And I do music. Me and my brother own a record label. We just sold out the House of Blues.</p>

<p>Sgt: When did you acquire that talent? When you was in jail?</p>

<p>BB: [Nods] You know, growing up you don't have your mind made up on what you're going to do. That's mainly because you don't know who you are. So when I got out, I got a second chance at life, and I don't take that lightly.</p>

<p>Sgt: In 2006, would you have sit up and talked to me? </p>

<p>BB: I would have not. I would never stop. You see all my peers gone.</p>

<p>Sgt: Me being a police officer here, this was my area. They would talk to me because they knew me. Now, if they do wrong they knew I was gonna put them in jail. But other than that, we gonna talk, we gonna rap. </p>

<p>BB: You gotta want better over here. You gotta want better for yourself.</p>

<p>Sgt:. Mm hm. And be an example.</p>

<p>BB: An example; there you go. I’m an example, right here, talking to you. I’m gonna sit at the corner store, I'm gonna be the motherfucker, you know what I’m saying? The example. For real. Follow me.</p>

<p>Busby glances across a trash-strewed field, where a group of men cast sidelong glances at him and the cop. He looks back to Smith.</p>

<p>“If they see me talking to you they ain’t gonna think, 'Oh, Godbody’s snitching,' Busby says. "Because my resumé’s solid enough to be talking to an officer. They know me as a man. My integrity and my morals and my background is up enough for me to sit here and talk to you, in front of everybody.”</p>

<p>They share a long handshake before Smith gets back in his SUV. </p>

<p>Busby remains on the corner, watching. A junk truck rattles up the street, a man on a bicycle loops the block, going nowhere, and the cop rolls out of Dixon.</p>

<p>"He the first one," Busby says, eyes chasing the traffic. "He the first one I ever seen to stop like that."</p>
