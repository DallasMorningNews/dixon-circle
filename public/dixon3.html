                <p>For months, undercover police had known that a house down the block from Dixon Grocery was full of drugs—a resupply warehouse for crack, pot and ecstasy dealers who staked out the corner. They were working on a sting operation, but late one afternoon a 911 call destroyed their plans.</p>

<p>"Five to six Hispanics with some guns just walked this black dude in the house with his hands tied up," the caller said, and then hung up. The call was fake—possibly the work of a rival gang—but the police rolled into Dixon that afternoon thinking they’d come to stop a kidnapping.</p>

<p>Three officers breached the house, and four men scattered out the windows, and the cops chased. An officer named Brian Rowden scrambled after James Harper—down an alley, over fences, and finally into a horse pen where they clung and grappled.</p>

<p>Rowden had lost his handcuffs in the chase, police would later explain. He was exhausted, they said, and Harper’s last words were: “You’re going to have to kill me.” Gunshots issued from the horse pen</p>

<p>Dixon Circle is a small neighborhood. Rumor that Harper had been shot in the back spread from house to house. An autopsy would later debunk that rumor. A grand jury would decide that Rowden was justified in firing. </p>

<p>But as ants swarmed over Harper’s corpse that evening, as his mother wailed in the street and a crowd swelled around the officers, the official version of events made little difference. </p>

                <p>Rev. Freeney: They knew he was a runner. They didn't have to kill him. He could have ran about 50 feet, as many policemen as was down here. Could have tazed him.</p>

<p>Paul Freeney: Set up a parameter on the other end. Could have. We don't know.</p>

<p>Rev. Freeney: He was wrong about selling the drugs too. He was wrong about selling drugs in the community. But they didn't have to kill him though. You've got many drug dealers that they haven't killed, and not having a gun, and fighting an officer. They haven't killed a lot of them so why kill Harper? </p>

                <p>Freddie followed the sound of gunshots to a shambling compound of shacks and barns at the edge of the neighborhood. There, in a busted horse pen, he saw a man known in Dixon as G-Code—James Harper, 29—face down in a pile of horse manure and ants.</p>

<p>The body lay a few inches from a fence that separated Harper from open fields, and a creek bed forest that marks Dixon’s eastern border.</p>

<p>“I call it the last jump,” Freddie says. “If he had jumped that fence, he was gone. The police knew this. So he did something to make this man fall like this.”</p>

<p>Smith couldn’t hear what the officers were saying from where he stood. But, he says, “what I saw wasn’t right.”</p>

<p>“You're laughing, you're joking you're shaking your hand like ‘I got him, I got him, I got him.’ Like y'all had killed a deer or something. That's what made me go into bad mode.” </p>

<p>As word of the killing spread down Dixon Avenue, people stepped from their houses. A crowd approached the police line—yelling, crying.</p>

<p>“They didn't know how to stop a riot,” Freddie says. </p>
