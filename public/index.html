		<h1>Life in <br/>Dixon Circle</h1>
		<h2>Placeholder text: Dixon is a broken neighborhood where residents tell their own stories. The stories shape their attitudes, and that may spell trouble down the road.</h2>
		<div class="bylineBlock">
			<p>By <a target="blank" href="mailto:aselk@dallasnews.com">Avi Selk</a> and <a href="mailto:jchiquillo@dallasnews.com">Julieta Chiquillo</a> | Staff Writers | Published Aug. 8, 2016</p>
			</div>
		<p>“I don’t think anyone saw this coming,” a news anchor said on the night a black man gunned down a dozen police downtown. The Dallas Police Department was praised across the country in days following, called a model of restrained policing and community outreach—an ironic target for a man enraged by police violence in other cities.</p>
		<p>And some who hailed the Dallas police remembered Dixon Circle, and what happened there in the summer of 2012. Police were reliably shooting a man every few weeks that year, until they killed an unarmed black man in one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods and nearly sparked a riot.</p>
		<p>Some feared the uprising would spread across Dallas before it was quelled. Afterwards, Police Chief David Brown promised Dixon much: stricter rules for cops, an end to the neighborhood’s ancient drug market, and a new trust between its people and the police.</p>
		<p>The chief backed his words with actions. And that’s how some remember Dixon Circle—a close call that brought great change.</p>
		<p>Those stories bear no resemblance to the memories told today in the circle, where a single month might see two men shot on the same corner, and old women carry baseball bats, and the police may be called oppressors or absent protectors, but rarely heroes.</p>
		<p>The people of Dixon—those who earn there, preach there, raised kids there or have killed there—they have their own stories of that summer and what came next, and what might be yet to come.</p>

        <h3>Dixon Circle</h3>
        <h4>Named for a knot of apartments at its northern extremity, Dixon Circle is a six-block stretch of maze-like complexes, boarded-up windows and tired but tidy homes. Even children eye outsiders with suspicion here, where a tired church and ancient drug corner stare at each other across the street.</h4>

                </div>
                <p>In the windowless office of his tiny church, the Rev. Earnest Freeney keeps a bloated Bible on his desk, foam bursting from its leather spine.</p>

<p>“Don't worry about the tore up part,” says the reverend, fanning through the pages of holy verse and margin scrawl. “That's the best part. It sure is."</p>

<p>Once, his church was the heartbeat of Dixon Circle—its apartments originally advertised as a modern homes for wealthy black families; and by the 80s devolved to gang fortresses, where bricks or bullets might greet a squad car that crossed the gates.</p>

<p>In the darkest days, thieves would break into Dixon Circle Missionary Baptist so often that Freeney stopped locking the doors to save money on repairs. And today, every day, young men loiter across the street in a convenience store parking lot—some dealing, some fighting, sometimes shooting. Their numbers dwarf the crowd at Freeney’s Sunday sermons.</p>

</div>

<p>The reverend leans forward and rests a gout-swollen hand on his forehead. “When your community gets a bad name it's hard, it's extremely hard to turn that around.”</p>

<p>And still, he would call Dixon a community: not a blight, not yet broken. “Only street that ever been swept in the city of Dallas every day,” he says. His church makes that happen, just as the reverend calls 911 for parishioners afraid to tell police about the crimes they see.</p>

<p>But Freeney’s been pastoring for nearly half his 77 years, and he is tired. His younger brother, Paul, is preparing to take over the church—and with it the responsibility of holding together a community unrecognizable from what it was. </p>

<p>“The Crips, the Bloods, the 357s, you name them—everybody in Dixon respects this man,” Paul says.</p>

                <h5>The closest thing to God</h5>
                <h6>as told by Bryson “Godbody” Busby</h6>
                <div class="imageGroup">

It has been more than four years since the police-involved shooting and death of James Harper on July 24, 2012. (Andy Jacobsohn/Staff Photographer)</p>
                </div>
<p>“I’m closer to these dudes than that church is. I’m the closest thing to God they have than that church,” says Bryson Busby, a mural of halos, crosses and music notes tattooed from the ends of his arms to the inside of one ear. </p>

<p>“That’s not taking nothing away from that church. He have members and he have people come over there. But I’m saying in my generation, that church don’t even really exist.”</p>

<p>Busby was born in Dixon. He had to leave the neighborhood when he was 18 because he killed a woman in the apartments down the street. He was aiming at a man who had shot at him days prior, he says. His bullet ricocheted and killed Ericka Bingmon, 22.</p>

<p>Busby got out of prison eight years later, not long after the unrest of 2012, and returned to find what order there had been in Dixon gone.</p>

<p>“It was more structured in 2006, community structure,” he says. “You could talk to people. Now, pretty much people have their own mind, free to do what you want to do. As they should be.”</p>

<p>Now 28, Busby expects he will soon be done with the corner soon. He’s going to school and has a budding music career, stage name Godbody. Last month, he and two friends shot a freestyle rap video in front of the church—dropping rhymes and mother-f-bombs between its spindly white columns. </p>

<p>His music will get him out of Dixon one day, but for now he spends his free time on this corner, staring across the street.</p>

<p>“We’re people of the community too, you know what I’m saying?” he says. “It’s not no neighborhood where we want to be known for no gangsterism stuff or no hoodlum stuff. It’s just a neighborhood where it happens.”</p>

                <p>"Where we got to go?” asks Freddie Smith, whacking weeds down the street from Dixon Grocery, flecks of paint on his shirt and grey in his beard.</p>

<p>He waves an arm along Dixon Avenue: block after block of gated apartments and treeless fields, bisected by a recreation center. “From this end to that end is apartments. We can't go stand in the Larry Johnson center. They got a law there saying you can't go in the center because it's a summertime camp. </p>

<p>He points behind him: “And you can't stand there because it's a church."</p>

<p>And so an ancient corner store’s parking lot has been the neighborhood’s social center for as long as most can remember. It’s where Dixon gathers for beers, dice and conversation. And yeah, Smith admits, some sell drugs there too. </p>

<p>But for him, that doesn’t excuse police barging in nearly every day, kicking beer cans, cuffing wrists and hassling the neighborhood.</p>

<p> “The other day, this young guy, the police made him stand in the sun about an hour,” Freddie says. “You ain’t searched him. He ain’t got nothing on him. That's what's making us angry. It's how you do the hood.”</p>

<p>"All the young kids doing now is trying to keep a dollar in their pockets. All of us know that we doing wrong. We got to pay the price for doing wrong. But it ain’t for you to come over, harassing us.”</p>

                </div>
                <p>At the park down the street, two old women smoke cigarettes under a tree. Their children are long since grown and gone from Dixon, raised here before it fell to ruin. Now they watching the school bus drop children off on the avenue, and the kids fly past the men on the corner, running all the way home. </p>

<p>They won’t speak of what goes on there unless their names are protected. One lady wears a straw hat, and the other carries a baseball bat in her purse.</p>

<p>Lady with bat: This used to be one of the nicest neighborhoods in Dallas, until everybody started calling it Dixon Circle. I called it – when I first moved here, it was called Sunny Acres Addition. </p>

<p>[She points up the street] Frankly, in this little area, that’s our main problem, that store</p>

<p>Lady with hat: Dixon is all right. That store? That’s the downfall of Dixon.</p>

<p>Bat: And half the people who hang at that store right now don’t live over here. And it’s so nasty down there. They eat, they drink, they don’t try to pick up, nothing. You find everything down there but some money.</p>

<p>Hat: They come and destroy our neighborhood. That’s what they do every day, seven days a week.</p>

<p>Bat: You don’t know if they’re going to knock you on your head, snatch your purse. I won’t even stop at the store. I take my bat that way. I’m not going to say I’ll use the bat, but they don’t know I won’t. And see, all those that know me, first thing they want to know is where is my bat!</p>

<p>Hat: They had two shootings in less than a month at the store. One boy got shot six times, and the other guy got his intestines shot out.</p>

<p>Bat: That store has been there forever, and that’s the worst owner we’ve ever had.</p>

<p>Hat: It’s the worst.</p>

                <h5>Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn</h5>
                <h6>as told by the shopkeeper</h6>
                <p>A stench of pot wafts into Dixon Grocery each time the door swings open, which it does constantly, whenever the men who loiter day and night in the parking lot need a beer or a cigar.</p>

<p>“I'm not going to lie to you. The money’s good,” says William Morel from behind the counter. His brother bought the store a few years ago, and he moved down from the Bronx to help run it. </p>

<p>“The money's good. But it's a little rough,” he says, glaring out the glass doors at the pack of men along his wall. "Selling drugs, all day. All kinds of drugs,” Morel says.</p>

<p>He taps a display case lined with trespass warnings. The police come when he calls, but they rarely linger. And the loiterers return as soon as they roll out.</p>

<p> Dixon is one of the poorest parts of Dallas—its median income about $20,000 a year. And scarcity breeds violence. Morel once had to punch out a troublemaker himself, he says, after the police failed to rouse the man.</p>

<p>Last April, an argument over a $20 or $100 debt led to a fistfight in his store, which led a man to walk outside and fetch his gun. </p>

<p>Morel lays his phone down on the counter and the scene plays out. Offscreen, someone says “damn” each time the gun goes off. Five times. Only after the shot man collapses does anyone scream. </p>

<p>Two weeks later, another man was shot in the same parking lot. </p>

<p>Morel thinks he’ll return to the Bronx soon.</p>

                </div>
                <p>For months, undercover police had known that a house down the block from Dixon Grocery was full of drugs—a resupply warehouse for crack, pot and ecstasy dealers who staked out the corner. They were working on a sting operation, but late one afternoon a 911 call destroyed their plans.</p>

<p>"Five to six Hispanics with some guns just walked this black dude in the house with his hands tied up," the caller said, and then hung up. The call was fake—possibly the work of a rival gang—but the police rolled into Dixon that afternoon thinking they’d come to stop a kidnapping.</p>

<p>Three officers breached the house, and four men scattered out the windows, and the cops chased. An officer named Brian Rowden scrambled after James Harper—down an alley, over fences, and finally into a horse pen where they clung and grappled.</p>

<p>Rowden had lost his handcuffs in the chase, police would later explain. He was exhausted, they said, and Harper’s last words were: “You’re going to have to kill me.” Gunshots issued from the horse pen</p>

<p>Dixon Circle is a small neighborhood. Rumor that Harper had been shot in the back spread from house to house. An autopsy would later debunk that rumor. A grand jury would decide that Rowden was justified in firing. </p>

<p>But as ants swarmed over Harper’s corpse that evening, as his mother wailed in the street and a crowd swelled around the officers, the official version of events made little difference. </p>

<p>Paul Freeney: Set up a parameter on the other end. Could have. We don't know.</p>

<p>Rev. Freeney: He was wrong about selling the drugs too. He was wrong about selling drugs in the community. But they didn't have to kill him though. You've got many drug dealers that they haven't killed, and not having a gun, and fighting an officer. They haven't killed a lot of them so why kill Harper? </p>

                </div>
                <p>Freddie followed the sound of gunshots to a shambling compound of shacks and barns at the edge of the neighborhood. There, in a busted horse pen, he saw a man known in Dixon as G-Code—James Harper, 29—face down in a pile of horse manure and ants.</p>

<p>The body lay a few inches from a fence that separated Harper from open fields, and a creek bed forest that marks Dixon’s eastern border.</p>

<p>“I call it the last jump,” Freddie says. “If he had jumped that fence, he was gone. The police knew this. So he did something to make this man fall like this.”</p>

<p>Smith couldn’t hear what the officers were saying from where he stood. But, he says, “what I saw wasn’t right.”</p>

<p>“You're laughing, you're joking you're shaking your hand like ‘I got him, I got him, I got him.’ Like y'all had killed a deer or something. That's what made me go into bad mode.” </p>

<p>As word of the killing spread down Dixon Avenue, people stepped from their houses. A crowd approached the police line—yelling, crying.</p>

<p>“They didn't know how to stop a riot,” Freddie says. </p>

                <p>Freddie walked away from the horse pen and stood in his yard, thinking about what he'd seen. He might have ended his day there, he says, had a police officer not ordered him inside.</p>

<p>"Why I got to go in my house because y'all have done something?" Freddie says. "Everybody started calling people. Everybody came from everywhere, because they knew that the police done shot somebody."</p>

<p>Harper's mother staggered up the avenue, held aloft by a swelling crowd. Harper’s sister stood at the police line, speaking in sobs: "Why they do this to my brother? Why they kill him?"</p>

<p>People watched from behind apartment fences, shooting cellphone video through coils of barbed wire. Then they poured into the street, and by evening people were driving from across the city to see the upheaval of Dixon Circle. </p>

<p>By the time a column of police in riot gear marched down Dixon, hundreds packed the avenue.</p>

<p>A fistfight broke out somewhere in the throng. Pistols flashed on both sides of the police line. An officer fired a burst of pellets into the street, trying to disperse the crowd.</p>

<p>Freddie Smith called himself a Black Panther than evening. "I see a lot of white folks and no black folks!" he screamed at the police as the sun sank over Dixon Avenue. </p>

                <p>In 1992, when Rev. Earnest Freeney’s church was young, a crowd along Dixon Avenue threw rocks and bottles at passing cars after four police officers in Los Angeles were acquitted of beating a black taxi driver, Rodney King. Twenty years later, as a crowd swelled outside Dixon Circle Missionary Baptist, the reverend and his brother went into the street to plead for peace.</p>

<p>Paul: When we were in the zone, what I call the zone, you have cops on one side with automatic weapons. You name it, they have it. And then you got, I'm gonna just say the people. Okay?</p>

<p>Rev. Freeney: I just thank God that I wasn't cut in half. Could have been.</p>

<p>Paul: You know, we had to tell a couple officers to stand down, because if he attempted to arrest a person he would create a riot. ‘Let him go home, even though he has a gun.’</p>

<p>Rev. Freeney: They had guns, and were ready to go to war. </p>

                <p>Dixon Circle’s city councilman walked into the crowd that evening knowing the neighborhood’s reputation, but with no idea what to expect.</p>

<p>“This was breaking news on every radio and every television station,” Dwaine Caraway says. "Folks that was mad, they start coming in from everywhere: Pleasant Grove, Oak Cliff, Duncanville, DeSoto. Everybody began to converge in on Dixon Circle.”</p>

<p>Caraway pressed through the throng, towards the body. At the police line, an officer in riot gear looked ready to crack. An assistant police chief had to pull him off the line.</p>

<p>Caraway praises the cops’ restraint that night. But the real danger was the crowd, growing ever larger and louder, feeding off the anguish of Harper’s family. </p>

<p>"Something was going to jump off,” Caraway says.</p>

<p>He persuaded police to let the family past the blockade—not to where the body lay, but at least to put a few feet between their sobs and the crowds shouts.</p>

<p>“Look, you lost your loved one,” he told the family, “I understand that.” </p>

<p>They cut him off: “They won’t let me go back and see him! I want to see my son!”</p>

<p>“And next thing you know, I’m told that the body had been removed,” Caraway says. “So now I had to go back to this family and tell them that.” </p>

<p>Another volley of anguish: “Oh, we knew they were lying!” </p>

<p>“They’re hollering so loud the crowd can hear them. Now the crowd is getting fizzed up,” Caraway says. </p>

<p>“I don’t know what the hell to say next. I looked up, and there was not a street light on this corner—and I know that if it got dark we would have a problem."</p>

<p>He told the police that the family had to go, lest the crowd boil over. Police agreed, and they coaxed Harper’s relatives into a vehicle with the promise that they could see Harper’s body at the morgue. Only after they were driven away did Dixon Circle fall quiet. </p>

<p>"Had we not handled it the way that it was handled, then they would have burned downtown," Caraway says. </p>

                <h5>The cops vs. Dixon Circle</h5>
                <h6>as told by Sgt. Smith</h6>
                <p>Sgt. Sheldon Smith patrolled Dixon in the early 1990s—when bricks or bullets were known to fly at squad cars. He’d been out of the neighborhood for a long time by 2012, when he turned on his TV and saw a screaming crowd in the avenue.</p>

<p>"It was a community in uproar," Smith says. "It needed immediate healing, and you were not going to get that in a squad car driving up and down Dixon.” For the last few years, Smith had been setting up athletic leagues for children in poor neighborhoods. That’s what Dixon needed.</p>

<p>He rolled up to the corner store slowly, approached a crowd of young men beneath the no loitering sign, and assured them he wasn’t there to search them.</p>

<p>“They was looking at me as if—I felt they thought I was crazy,” he says. “I just had to keep talking until they talked.”</p>

<p>When he got talking basketball and Dixon’s little kids, cold stares finally broke. One of the men pointed down the avenue and told Smith: “the kids across the street in that apartment complex—they'll come out and play with you."</p>

<p>And so began a sort of golden era in Dixon Circle. Corner boys would come down to the rec center to watch the children play. More came every week, Smith says, and before long they wanted to play too.</p>

<p>That first game was tense, Smith remembered. A team of corner boys shoved and jostled his officers. But dozens of young men came back to the gym week, sometimes lingering to ask an officer for advice with a warrant or such.</p>

<p>It got us to get that community,” Smith says. “The next time an officer pulled up to the store, they looked to see if they knew” anyone on the corner. "In the end those guys would fight each other because they wanted to play on the police team.”</p>

<p>It only lasted a few months. Smith’s team moved to another broken neighborhood across the city, and police communication with the young men of Dixon Circle reverted to the usual cycle of patrols, searches and arrests.</p>

<p>"I drive through there occasionally just to see if I see any of those guys," Smith says. "I haven't seen them."</p>

<p>  Do you remember the police playing basketball with residents here at the rec?</p>

<p>  Yeah. Then they start slacking. And you know how most people are. You stop making an appearance, they feel like they can go back to their old ways.</p>

<p>  So you think that their presence here helped after the shooting?</p>

<p>  Yeah, it helped a whole lot.</p>

<p>  Not really.</p>

<p>  So what improved during that time?</p>

                <p>The shooting death of James Harper inspired Chief David Brown to make changes.</p>

                <p>Dallas’ new police chief, David Brown, was disturbed by the turmoil after Harper’s death—especially when rumors that he’d been shot in the back persisted after an autopsy debunked them.</p>

                <p>The chief pushed through forms—some unpopular with his own rank and file. He made cops record proof of consent when they searched someone without a warrant, and prohibiting them from chasing suspects for minor crimes like Harper’s. </p>

                <p>But the chief promised Dixon even more: a special team of community officers, more outreach programs for the neighborhood, and eventually restoration of trust with police.</p>

                <p>Today, not much is left of those promises. Some of Brown’s reforms were reversed last year. A program in which police played basketball with Dixon’s corner boys is remembered fondly. But it’s long gone.</p>

                <p>“Our programs ebb and flow depending on what else is down there for the kids,” says Lt. Sally Lannom, who is in charge of stretching the department’s youth outreach resources across Dallas’ many pockets of poverty and blight.</p>

                <p>When the police come to Dixon, which they do now and then, they come for small children and usually take them far north of Interstate 30—to the sculptured shopping mall NorthPark Center, or a bowling alley in Plano.</p>

                <p>But when police advertised a field day in June, only six neighborhood children showed up. The cops gave a pile of uneaten hot dogs to another program.</p>

                <p>Lanmon sounds puzzled by the neighborhood’s tepid response, and wonders if it has something to do with ancient history. “Your iconic pictures from the civil rights era: it’s the police … keeping people from doing what basically they should have been allowed to do,” she says.</p>

                <p>A 9th grade dropout, now 50, Freddie Smith has been in and out of jail for half his life. “When I see the polices, I start shaking,” he says. “My heart starts fluttering, because I don't know what you got on your mind.” In all his years on Dixon, he remembers a single cop he liked. </p>

<p>The memory of that cop launches Freddie into a monologue on the sidewalk, grinning the whole time.</p>

<p>We had one cop. One cop! I call him the Terminator. He's a white, bald-headed guy, and I love him, I swear.</p>

<p>One day I was driving down through the hood. I be driving trash and stuff. I get there, coming through there, flying. “Uh-oh! The police behind me!”   He get behind me, pull up in my yard. I called him Terminator. He said, “My name ain’t that!” and “You better watch that, driving that truck.” He didn't get me saying, “Oh, I’m going to slam you down.”</p>

<p>He don't be letting us going with nothing. He's a tough man. But ain’t nobody going to run from him. He'd come walk up to you: “Uh, you know I got you for a warrant, right?”   “Yessir!”</p>

<p>Everybody loved the Terminator. When he came in the hood he didn't come in there harassing nobody. Nobody ran! I bet you the Terminator could walk from here all the way down and in the hood. Everybody kids going to come and hug him. “Hey, Terminator! How you doing?” Waving him down. He got so tired of waving.</p>

<p>If you could talk about a good cop, that's a good cop. I haven't seen him in a while. </p>

<p>Johnson gave $1 million to the city to build a recreation center that is now the neighborhood’s sanctuary. No drugs here, no bullets. The sound of children’s laughter and splashing fountains mask the traffic and disorder across the street like a force field.</p>

<p>Across the avenue from the park, a lattice of steel stands two stories high in a patch of weeds. It has stood like that for ten years. And this was also Johnson’s hand.</p>

<p>Some in the neighborhood say it was going to be a rehab center, or maybe a church. He had intended to build a child care facility, according to city records. No one involved with the project returned calls about it. </p>

<p>Johnson lives in New York now, and isn’t seen in Dixon anymore. </p>

                <p>"That was probably the sergeant,” Freddie says. “They gonna come back round, you'll see. He'll send his boys."</p>

<p>He reconsiders. Police have stepped light in Dixon Circle since five of them were shot downtown. "They don't know who's crazy now," Freddie says.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, he was taken in a raid on the drug infested apartments down the street, charged with dealing and sentenced to prison for seven years. He says they planted it.</p>

<p>He did seven years, got out, saw the inside of a cell a handful more times for little things.</p>

<p>And then one evening in 2014, two years after James Harper was killed, a traffic cop spotted Freddie riding a bicycle the wrong way down Dixon Avenue, and hit his sirens.</p>

<p>Smith kept pedaling—almost made it through the door of his house before an officer caught him. "I ain't doing nothing," he said, according to his arrest report. "Just trying to smoke my weed." According to Freddie, the cop planted two joints on him.</p>

<p>The officer grabbed his arm. Freddie yelled. He threatened to start up more riots. He screamed until they shoved him into a patrol car and took him away to serve 18 months for evasion and drug possession.</p>

<p>Today, he’s on probation. He says he avoids the corner, and is more likely to spend his evenings cutting weeds along the avenue.</p>

<p>But one way or the other, Freddie says, he’s done with police.</p>

<p> "If I go to jail again I'm going to do about 50 years, just because they lied on me from that time to this time,” Smith says. "This is my last round. If I ever get tied up with a police officer, this time he got to kill me."</p>

                </div>
                <p>The sergeant asks Busby he remembers when police played basketball in Dixon Circle, after the near-riot. Busby was in prison at the time, but the two men get to talking. They speak not of basketball, but of cops and the corner.</p>

<p>Bryson Busby: We scared of them; they scared of us. You know what I'm saying? Everybody's scared. Shit got our women scared. I been getting texts lately, like: ‘make sure you let me know that you're in the house.’ All my years growing up and being affiliated in the streets, and moving how I move, I ain’t never got any texts like that.</p>

<p>Sgt. Smith: What about the crime? The jacking, the robbing. We got one eye open all the time.</p>

<p>BB: I know how to see a jack boy coming. I can't tell no friendly police officer, if you ready to help me or you ready to take me down.</p>

<p>Sgt: You been to jail before?</p>

<p>BB: I just got out two and a half years now. Seven years, seven months on an eight year sentence for a murder case I caught right across the street.</p>

<p>Sgt: So, you working?</p>

<p>BB: I go to the barber college up on Martin Luther King.</p>

<p>Sgt: Excellent. Excellent</p>

<p>BB: I'm about a month away from graduating. And I do music. Me and my brother own a record label. We just sold out the House of Blues.</p>

<p>Sgt: When did you acquire that talent? When you was in jail?</p>

<p>BB: [Nods] You know, growing up you don't have your mind made up on what you're going to do. That's mainly because you don't know who you are. So when I got out, I got a second chance at life, and I don't take that lightly.</p>

<p>Sgt: In 2006, would you have sit up and talked to me? </p>

<p>BB: I would have not. I would never stop. You see all my peers gone.</p>

<p>Sgt: Me being a police officer here, this was my area. They would talk to me because they knew me. Now, if they do wrong they knew I was gonna put them in jail. But other than that, we gonna talk, we gonna rap. </p>

<p>BB: You gotta want better over here. You gotta want better for yourself.</p>

<p>Sgt:. Mm hm. And be an example.</p>

<p>BB: An example; there you go. I’m an example, right here, talking to you. I’m gonna sit at the corner store, I'm gonna be the motherfucker, you know what I’m saying? The example. For real. Follow me.</p>

<p>Busby glances across a trash-strewed field, where a group of men cast sidelong glances at him and the cop. He looks back to Smith.</p>

<p>“If they see me talking to you they ain’t gonna think, 'Oh, Godbody’s snitching,' Busby says. "Because my resumé’s solid enough to be talking to an officer. They know me as a man. My integrity and my morals and my background is up enough for me to sit here and talk to you, in front of everybody.”</p>

<p>They share a long handshake before Smith gets back in his SUV. </p>

<p>Busby remains on the corner, watching. A junk truck rattles up the street, a man on a bicycle loops the block, going nowhere, and the cop rolls out of Dixon.</p>

<p>"He the first one," Busby says, eyes chasing the traffic. "He the first one I ever seen to stop like that."</p>
