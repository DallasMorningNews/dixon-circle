                <h5>The cops vs. Dixon Circle</h5>
                <h6>as told by Sgt. Smith</h6>
                <p>Sgt. Sheldon Smith patrolled Dixon in the early 1990s—when bricks or bullets were known to fly at squad cars. He’d been out of the neighborhood for a long time by 2012, when he turned on his TV and saw a screaming crowd in the avenue.</p>

<p>"It was a community in uproar," Smith says. "It needed immediate healing, and you were not going to get that in a squad car driving up and down Dixon.” For the last few years, Smith had been setting up athletic leagues for children in poor neighborhoods. That’s what Dixon needed.</p>

<p>He rolled up to the corner store slowly, approached a crowd of young men beneath the no loitering sign, and assured them he wasn’t there to search them.</p>

<p>“They was looking at me as if—I felt they thought I was crazy,” he says. “I just had to keep talking until they talked.”</p>

<p>When he got talking basketball and Dixon’s little kids, cold stares finally broke. One of the men pointed down the avenue and told Smith: “the kids across the street in that apartment complex—they'll come out and play with you."</p>

<p>And so began a sort of golden era in Dixon Circle. Corner boys would come down to the rec center to watch the children play. More came every week, Smith says, and before long they wanted to play too.</p>

<p>That first game was tense, Smith remembered. A team of corner boys shoved and jostled his officers. But dozens of young men came back to the gym week, sometimes lingering to ask an officer for advice with a warrant or such.</p>

<p>It got us to get that community,” Smith says. “The next time an officer pulled up to the store, they looked to see if they knew” anyone on the corner. "In the end those guys would fight each other because they wanted to play on the police team.”</p>

<p>It only lasted a few months. Smith’s team moved to another broken neighborhood across the city, and police communication with the young men of Dixon Circle reverted to the usual cycle of patrols, searches and arrests.</p>

<p>"I drive through there occasionally just to see if I see any of those guys," Smith says. "I haven't seen them."</p>

                <p>How often do you see police?</p>

<p>  I see them drive by. Now when that guy first got killed…when they first shot that boy – they walked the neighborhood for I’d say maybe, I’m going to give them a month.</p>

<p>  Do you remember the police playing basketball with residents here at the rec?</p>

<p>  Yeah. Then they start slacking. And you know how most people are. You stop making an appearance, they feel like they can go back to their old ways.</p>

<p>  So you think that their presence here helped after the shooting?</p>

<p>  Yeah, it helped a whole lot.</p>

<p>  Did the drug dealers move out of the grocery store?</p>

<p>  Not really.</p>

<p>  So what improved during that time?</p>

<p>  Nothing. To me, it just makes me more comfortable. I can’t speak for nobody else.</p>

                <p>The shooting death of James Harper inspired Chief David Brown to make changes.</p>

                <p>Dallas’ new police chief, David Brown, was disturbed by the turmoil after Harper’s death—especially when rumors that he’d been shot in the back persisted after an autopsy debunked them.</p>

                <p>The chief pushed through forms—some unpopular with his own rank and file. He made cops record proof of consent when they searched someone without a warrant, and prohibiting them from chasing suspects for minor crimes like Harper’s. </p>

                <p>But the chief promised Dixon even more: a special team of community officers, more outreach programs for the neighborhood, and eventually restoration of trust with police.</p>

                <p>Today, not much is left of those promises. Some of Brown’s reforms were reversed last year. A program in which police played basketball with Dixon’s corner boys is remembered fondly. But it’s long gone.</p>

                <p>“Our programs ebb and flow depending on what else is down there for the kids,” says Lt. Sally Lannom, who is in charge of stretching the department’s youth outreach resources across Dallas’ many pockets of poverty and blight.</p>

                <p>When the police come to Dixon, which they do now and then, they come for small children and usually take them far north of Interstate 30—to the sculptured shopping mall NorthPark Center, or a bowling alley in Plano.</p>

                <p>But when police advertised a field day in June, only six neighborhood children showed up. The cops gave a pile of uneaten hot dogs to another program.</p>

                <p>Lanmon sounds puzzled by the neighborhood’s tepid response, and wonders if it has something to do with ancient history. “Your iconic pictures from the civil rights era: it’s the police … keeping people from doing what basically they should have been allowed to do,” she says.</p>

                <p>A 9th grade dropout, now 50, Freddie Smith has been in and out of jail for half his life. “When I see the polices, I start shaking,” he says. “My heart starts fluttering, because I don't know what you got on your mind.” In all his years on Dixon, he remembers a single cop he liked. </p>

<p>The memory of that cop launches Freddie into a monologue on the sidewalk, grinning the whole time.</p>

<p>We had one cop. One cop! I call him the Terminator. He's a white, bald-headed guy, and I love him, I swear.</p>

<p>One day I was driving down through the hood. I be driving trash and stuff. I get there, coming through there, flying. “Uh-oh! The police behind me!”   He get behind me, pull up in my yard. I called him Terminator. He said, “My name ain’t that!” and “You better watch that, driving that truck.” He didn't get me saying, “Oh, I’m going to slam you down.”</p>

<p>He don't be letting us going with nothing. He's a tough man. But ain’t nobody going to run from him. He'd come walk up to you: “Uh, you know I got you for a warrant, right?”   “Yessir!”</p>

<p>Everybody loved the Terminator. When he came in the hood he didn't come in there harassing nobody. Nobody ran! I bet you the Terminator could walk from here all the way down and in the hood. Everybody kids going to come and hug him. “Hey, Terminator! How you doing?” Waving him down. He got so tired of waving.</p>

<p>If you could talk about a good cop, that's a good cop. I haven't seen him in a while. </p>
