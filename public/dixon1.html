        <h3>Dixon Circle</h3>
        <h4>Named for a knot of apartments at its northern extremity, Dixon Circle is a six-block stretch of maze-like complexes, boarded-up windows and tired but tidy homes. Even children eye outsiders with suspicion here, where a tired church and ancient drug corner stare at each other across the street.</h4>

                <h5>The tore up part</h5>
                <h6>as told by the reverend</h6>

                <p>In the windowless office of his tiny church, the Rev. Earnest Freeney keeps a bloated Bible on his desk, foam bursting from its leather spine.</p>

<p>“Don't worry about the tore up part,” says the reverend, fanning through the pages of holy verse and margin scrawl. “That's the best part. It sure is."</p>

<p>Once, his church was the heartbeat of Dixon Circle—its apartments originally advertised as a modern homes for wealthy black families; and by the 80s devolved to gang fortresses, where bricks or bullets might greet a squad car that crossed the gates.</p>

<p>In the darkest days, thieves would break into Dixon Circle Missionary Baptist so often that Freeney stopped locking the doors to save money on repairs. And today, every day, young men loiter across the street in a convenience store parking lot—some dealing, some fighting, sometimes shooting. Their numbers dwarf the crowd at Freeney’s Sunday sermons.</p>

<p>The reverend leans forward and rests a gout-swollen hand on his forehead. “When your community gets a bad name it's hard, it's extremely hard to turn that around.”</p>

<p>And still, he would call Dixon a community: not a blight, not yet broken. “Only street that ever been swept in the city of Dallas every day,” he says. His church makes that happen, just as the reverend calls 911 for parishioners afraid to tell police about the crimes they see.</p>

<p>But Freeney’s been pastoring for nearly half his 77 years, and he is tired. His younger brother, Paul, is preparing to take over the church—and with it the responsibility of holding together a community unrecognizable from what it was. </p>

<p>“The Crips, the Bloods, the 357s, you name them—everybody in Dixon respects this man,” Paul says.</p>

                <h5>The closest thing to God</h5>
                <h6>as told by Bryson “Godbody” Busby</h6>
                <div class="imageGroup">

<p>“I’m closer to these dudes than that church is. I’m the closest thing to God they have than that church,” says Bryson Busby, a mural of halos, crosses and music notes tattooed from the ends of his arms to the inside of one ear. </p>

<p>“That’s not taking nothing away from that church. He have members and he have people come over there. But I’m saying in my generation, that church don’t even really exist.”</p>

<p>Busby was born in Dixon. He had to leave the neighborhood when he was 18 because he killed a woman in the apartments down the street. He was aiming at a man who had shot at him days prior, he says. His bullet ricocheted and killed Ericka Bingmon, 22.</p>

<p>Busby got out of prison eight years later, not long after the unrest of 2012, and returned to find what order there had been in Dixon gone.</p>

<p>“It was more structured in 2006, community structure,” he says. “You could talk to people. Now, pretty much people have their own mind, free to do what you want to do. As they should be.”</p>

<p>Now 28, Busby expects he will soon be done with the corner soon. He’s going to school and has a budding music career, stage name Godbody. Last month, he and two friends shot a freestyle rap video in front of the church—dropping rhymes and mother-f-bombs between its spindly white columns. </p>

<p>His music will get him out of Dixon one day, but for now he spends his free time on this corner, staring across the street.</p>

<p>“We’re people of the community too, you know what I’m saying?” he says. “It’s not no neighborhood where we want to be known for no gangsterism stuff or no hoodlum stuff. It’s just a neighborhood where it happens.”</p>
