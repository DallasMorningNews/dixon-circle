        <h4>A weed wacker in his hand, Freddie Smith watches a squad car speed down the avenue, across the railroad tracks and out of Dixon Circle.</h4>

                <p>"That was probably the sergeant,” Freddie says. “They gonna come back round, you'll see. He'll send his boys."</p>

<p>He reconsiders. Police have stepped light in Dixon Circle since five of them were shot downtown. "They don't know who's crazy now," Freddie says.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, he was taken in a raid on the drug infested apartments down the street, charged with dealing and sentenced to prison for seven years. He says they planted it.</p>

<p>He did seven years, got out, saw the inside of a cell a handful more times for little things.</p>

<p>And then one evening in 2014, two years after James Harper was killed, a traffic cop spotted Freddie riding a bicycle the wrong way down Dixon Avenue, and hit his sirens.</p>

<p>Smith kept pedaling—almost made it through the door of his house before an officer caught him. "I ain't doing nothing," he said, according to his arrest report. "Just trying to smoke my weed." According to Freddie, the cop planted two joints on him.</p>

<p>The officer grabbed his arm. Freddie yelled. He threatened to start up more riots. He screamed until they shoved him into a patrol car and took him away to serve 18 months for evasion and drug possession.</p>

<p>Today, he’s on probation. He says he avoids the corner, and is more likely to spend his evenings cutting weeds along the avenue.</p>

<p>But one way or the other, Freddie says, he’s done with police.</p>

<p> "If I go to jail again I'm going to do about 50 years, just because they lied on me from that time to this time,” Smith says. "This is my last round. If I ever get tied up with a police officer, this time he got to kill me."</p>
