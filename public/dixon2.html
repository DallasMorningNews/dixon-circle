        <h4>Dixon Grocery is either an open-air drug market, a community hangout or the downfall of the neighborhood—depending whom you ask.</h4>

                <p>"Where we got to go?” asks Freddie Smith, whacking weeds down the street from Dixon Grocery, flecks of paint on his shirt and grey in his beard.</p>

<p>He waves an arm along Dixon Avenue: block after block of gated apartments and treeless fields, bisected by a recreation center. “From this end to that end is apartments. We can't go stand in the Larry Johnson center. They got a law there saying you can't go in the center because it's a summertime camp. </p>

<p>He points behind him: “And you can't stand there because it's a church."</p>

<p>And so an ancient corner store’s parking lot has been the neighborhood’s social center for as long as most can remember. It’s where Dixon gathers for beers, dice and conversation. And yeah, Smith admits, some sell drugs there too. </p>

<p>But for him, that doesn’t excuse police barging in nearly every day, kicking beer cans, cuffing wrists and hassling the neighborhood.</p>

<p> “The other day, this young guy, the police made him stand in the sun about an hour,” Freddie says. “You ain’t searched him. He ain’t got nothing on him. That's what's making us angry. It's how you do the hood.”</p>

<p>"All the young kids doing now is trying to keep a dollar in their pockets. All of us know that we doing wrong. We got to pay the price for doing wrong. But it ain’t for you to come over, harassing us.”</p>

                <p>At the park down the street, two old women smoke cigarettes under a tree. Their children are long since grown and gone from Dixon, raised here before it fell to ruin. Now they watching the school bus drop children off on the avenue, and the kids fly past the men on the corner, running all the way home. </p>

<p>They won’t speak of what goes on there unless their names are protected. One lady wears a straw hat, and the other carries a baseball bat in her purse.</p>

<p>Lady with bat: This used to be one of the nicest neighborhoods in Dallas, until everybody started calling it Dixon Circle. I called it – when I first moved here, it was called Sunny Acres Addition. </p>

<p>[She points up the street] Frankly, in this little area, that’s our main problem, that store</p>

<p>Lady with hat: Dixon is all right. That store? That’s the downfall of Dixon.</p>

<p>Bat: And half the people who hang at that store right now don’t live over here. And it’s so nasty down there. They eat, they drink, they don’t try to pick up, nothing. You find everything down there but some money.</p>

<p>Hat: They come and destroy our neighborhood. That’s what they do every day, seven days a week.</p>

<p>Bat: You don’t know if they’re going to knock you on your head, snatch your purse. I won’t even stop at the store. I take my bat that way. I’m not going to say I’ll use the bat, but they don’t know I won’t. And see, all those that know me, first thing they want to know is where is my bat!</p>

<p>Hat: They had two shootings in less than a month at the store. One boy got shot six times, and the other guy got his intestines shot out.</p>

<p>Bat: That store has been there forever, and that’s the worst owner we’ve ever had.</p>

<p>Hat: It’s the worst.</p>

                <h5>Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn</h5>
                <h6>as told by the shopkeeper</h6>
                <p>A stench of pot wafts into Dixon Grocery each time the door swings open, which it does constantly, whenever the men who loiter day and night in the parking lot need a beer or a cigar.</p>

<p>“I'm not going to lie to you. The money’s good,” says William Morel from behind the counter. His brother bought the store a few years ago, and he moved down from the Bronx to help run it. </p>

<p>“The money's good. But it's a little rough,” he says, glaring out the glass doors at the pack of men along his wall. "Selling drugs, all day. All kinds of drugs,” Morel says.</p>

<p>He taps a display case lined with trespass warnings. The police come when he calls, but they rarely linger. And the loiterers return as soon as they roll out.</p>

<p> Dixon is one of the poorest parts of Dallas—its median income about $20,000 a year. And scarcity breeds violence. Morel once had to punch out a troublemaker himself, he says, after the police failed to rouse the man.</p>

<p>Last April, an argument over a $20 or $100 debt led to a fistfight in his store, which led a man to walk outside and fetch his gun. </p>

<p>Morel lays his phone down on the counter and the scene plays out. Offscreen, someone says “damn” each time the gun goes off. Five times. Only after the shot man collapses does anyone scream. </p>

<p>Two weeks later, another man was shot in the same parking lot. </p>

<p>Morel thinks he’ll return to the Bronx soon.</p>
